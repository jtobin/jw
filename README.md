*jw* (for 'just write') is a simple tool for regular writing, inspired by
services like [750 Words](http://750words.com/).

## Why Would I Even

The idea is simple: writing is enjoyable, and writing regularly can be both
[satisfying and productive](https://www.amazon.com/How-Write-Lot-Practical-Productive/dp/1591477433).
This is true even (especially?) if you're just writing for yourself as a sort
of regular brain dump - writing frequently tends to keep the 'writing muscles'
fresh, and, at least for me, makes the act of writing much easier and more
natural.

To write regularly, it's nice to have a simple system for just getting right
down to things without much mucking around.  *jw* tries to put something like
that together; just open your favourite editor and write, and *jw* will handle
the rest - naming and organizing files, monitoring you progress, and so on.
It's just a simple wrapper around commonly-used unix tools, so it's extensible
and all that, and can probably be customized to the most demanding of writing
routines.
